Topshelf is a .NET framework for C# and will need a .NET runtime to run on.

To work with Topshelf you will need to be running on a Windows operating
system. The developers of Topshelf regularly test on Windows 7 and
Windows Server 2008RC2. Topshelf should still work on Windows Server 2003, as
long as .NET 3.5 Service Pack 1 is installed.
